/**
 * \brief Wrapper for bScreen.
 *
 * bScreens are IDs and thus stored in a main list-base. We also want to store a list-base of them within the
 * workspace (so each workspace can have its own set of screen-layouts) which would mess with the next/prev pointers.
 * So we use this struct to wrap a bScreen pointer with another pair of next/prev pointers.
 *
 * We could also use LinkNode for this but in future we may want to move stuff from bScreen to this level.
